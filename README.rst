Installation
------------

Begin by cloning the Git repository

   git clone git@github.com:makerplane/pyAvMap.git

..

   git clone https://github.com/makerplane/pyAvMap.git

If you’d like to install the program permanently to your system or into
a virtualenv you can issue the command…

   sudo pip3 install .

from the root directory of the source repository. **Caution** This
feature is still in development and may not work consistently.

Requirements
------------

Download chart(s) from FAA website.
``https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/digital_products/``

::

   Unzip them into pyAvMap/charts/Sectional/<ChartName>   # Should include *.tif and *.htm and *.tfw(x)
   cd pyAvMap/charts/Sectional/<ChartName>
   pyAvMap/make_tiles/make_tiles.py <base_file_name> # e.g. "Albuquerque SEC 101"
   rm pyAvMap/charts/Sectional/<ChartName>/*.tif             # after the tiles are created, you don't need the humongo tiff anymore

The above example is for sectional charts. Other directory names for
other chart types are: 1. IFR 1. Jet 1. Terminal

Some IFR charts are laid out so that North is approximately in the width
direction rather than the height direction. L-01 and L-02 are examples
of this. In this case, add a second argument of “1” (the number without
quotes) to the ``make_tiles.py`` command line, and that will rotate the
chart so it’s oriented correctly.

Dependencies
------------

The pyAvTools repo should be cloned adjacent to pyAvMap. You should use
makerplane/pyAvTools.
